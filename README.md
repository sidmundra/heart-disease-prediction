# heart-disease-prediction
Python programming is used for the implementation of classification techniques and WX python for the implementation of the GUI. 
The UCI dataset consists of 303 records in the Heart diseases database. 
The data mining classification algorithms namely KNN, Naïve Bayes, Random Forest, SVM, LR and Decision Tree are implemented and compared for their accuracy.
To run the code:
In the solution_BE.py file, give your path for the dataset to read the csv file
 The dataset  used  Cleveland dataset containing 303 instances. This dataset contains total 76 attributes out of which only 14 attributes are used in this code for prediction of heart disease.

A graphical user interface has been developed using wx-python which has the same parameters as that of the dataset and after comparison of the accuracy of all the algorithms, Random Forest was found to be the one with highest accuracy. Therefore, Random Forest is being used for the prediction and is connected to the GUI to predict whether a person has heart disease or not based on the user’s input.
